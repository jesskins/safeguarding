# Bugs 

**404 not found**
- Ironically, I haven't been able to link the 404.html to the server, so no personalised 404 message unfortunately. This is not a priority and can be left for a future update. 

**General formatting**
- Formatting of font, and some features have not been consistently applied. This could do with going over to override some futher elements which have been targetted by bootstrap. 

**Performance and accessibility**
- Performance and accessibility could and should be improved. There are sections of code which are not really needed/can be cut down to improve speed. Some content missing accessibility labels, headers which do not follow in perfect order. Not finished due to time constraints.
