# Bugs 

**404 not found**
- Ironically, I haven't been able to link the 404.html to the server, so no personalised 404 message unfortunately. This is not a priority and can be left for a future update. 

**General formatting**
- Formatting of font, and some features have not been consistently applied. This could do with going over to override some futher elements which have been targetted by bootstrap. 


# Current Website features 

## Future features
- Working 404 Not Found page.
- Signs of abuse - video link and summary to go below "what is safeguarding" section. 
- Toolkit and prep list to ensure best able to safeguard. 
- Forum and FAQ section specifically to discuss topic.
